Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a new virus.
The disease causes respiratory illness (like the flu) with symptoms such as a
cough, fever, and in more severe cases, difficulty breathing. You can protect
yourself by washing your hands frequently, avoiding touching your face, and
avoiding close contact (1 meter or 3 feet) with people who are unwell.

Lets stay safe during covid 19 by staying at home.
I can do an approximation if you do have coronavirus.
