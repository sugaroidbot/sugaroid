Sugaroid is a new Artificial Intelligence which uses Natural Language
Processing (NLP) with Machine Learning and neural networks to manipulate

``Python 3.8.2`` and was built out of personal interest, to tackle three
important issues in the Python framework.

-  Natural Language Processing / Machine Learning
