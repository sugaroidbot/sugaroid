Sugaroid
========

Introduction
------------

Sugaroid is a new Artificial Intelligence which uses Natural Language
Processing (NLP) with Machine Learning and neural networks to manipulate
user input to provide a intuitive response. The AI is built on
``Python 3.8.2`` and was built out of personal interest, to tackle three
important issues in the Python framework.

-  Natural Language Processing / Machine Learning
-  Graphical User Interface
-  Database Management, Configuration file management and Web
   Development

Sugaroid Chatbot has a comprehensive and modular interface utilizing
Object Oriented Programming to benefit activities of
`Sugarlabs <https://www.sugarlabs.org>`__, a non-profit educational
organization. Initially built to serve as a companion bot, the Sugaroid
Virtual Assistant helps to comprehend most of the messages, to generate
a probable response. The future plans of sugaroid aims to extend
Sugaroid as a documentation reader of which beta previews are
``still under testing``.

The Sugaroid bot is deployed in production servers particularly for
testing.
