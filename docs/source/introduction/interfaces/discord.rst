Discord Bot
-----------

Sugaroid also has a discord instance running on a ``Heroku`` server.
Sugaroid Discord bot is powered by Python Async IO, to get faster
results and ``discord.py``. The discord bot is (somewhat) frequently
tested by developers to find it out bugs. The message from the bot is
demojized to remove static unicode emoji’s and then converted into
``emocodes`` which is better than unicode emoji’s on Discord.
