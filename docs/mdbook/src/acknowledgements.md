# Acknowledgements 

**Sugaroid AI** has become possible to millions of open 
source developers. Particularly to mention, I would like
to thank **[@GuntherCox](https://github.com/gunthercox)** 
for the `chatterbot` library and 
**[@explosion](https://explosion.ai) 
for [`spaCy`](https://github.com/explosion/spaCy)** , 
the machine learning library with which it was possible to 
make natural language processing easy as pie. 
Also, the millions of word collection on `en_core_web_sm`, 
`en_core_web_md` was contributed by developers across the globe
for translation and linguistic differentiation.
Special thanks to contributors, **Sreya Saju** 
(aka [@sreyasaju](https://github.com/sreyasaju)) and **Joel Anil Chacko** (aka [@TheDarkDrake](https://github.com/TheDarkDrake))
